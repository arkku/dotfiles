This repository contains my "public" shell configuration files. The ones in this
repository are selected to not contain nothing specific to me, so in theory they
could be used by others.

Possibly the most interesting thing is the `link_files` script, which is used
to hard-link the files from this repository into the home directory, while
allowing platform-specific files and local overrides.
