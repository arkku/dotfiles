# Arkku's .dotfiles

This repository contains my "public" shell configuration files. The ones in this
repository are not in any way specific to me, and could theoretically be used
by others who share similar preferences.

However, possibly the most interesting thing here is the `link_files` script,
which is used to hard-link the files from this repository into the home
directory, while allowing platform-specific files and local overrides.
